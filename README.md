# Awesome Books

In this project I created a plain HTMl website and added JavaScript for removing and adding books to the library and loading books from the localStorage.
I then made the website a single page application using JavaScript and CSS.
I also used ES6 syntax rules in the JavaScript code as well as modularized the javascript and used luxon package to display the date below the navigation bar.  

## Built With

- HTMl, CSS and JavaScript
